# Drag-drop-Repak-for-Stalker-2
Drag and drop a folder on top of the bat file to automatically repack to pak

Made a bat file to drag and drop the folder on top of it to repack mods.
You need to have **Repak** installed with the .msi file download or the exe on the same folder as the bat.
The file name will be the same as the folder_name.pak.

*It also, checks for json files and renames any json file inside the folder back to cfg*
